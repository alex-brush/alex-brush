# Hello visitor, I am glad to see you here. 

I am @alex-brush. I am but a simple man. I put my shoes on one foot at a time, I keep most of my repositories private unless they are actually worth sharing, <br>
and I value freedom in pursuit of technological progress. This is not my world, it is not your world, it is **our** world. As long as you treat me (and others) with respect, <br>
I will treat you with respect. Everyone deserves at least that, even if it makes me look bad I do not care, that is a small price to pay. <br>

***This isn't just a job to me, it is a hobby as well as passion. I am interested in what you do as well, even if it is not relevant to my career!***

## Here are the ***Specific Things I Enjoy***:

- Mathematics and Programming
> Cybersecurity, Reverse-Engineering, Systems level mostly, but I will learn whatever is necessary.
> Proofs, Logic, Complex Systems and Graphs. These things are relevant to programming, but more of a **passion** specifically.

- Music and General Arts
> I have about 10+ years of experience playing music. It is easier to name the instruments I dont play: 
> - Winds or Brass *things you blow into in general*
> - Anchient/Obscure Instruments *ones that are not used often in modern times, athough I find them very interesting*
> - Vocalizations *I can sing, everyone **can** sing, I do not perform vocals though*
> 
> ***Anything with strings, keys, or a something similiar, I can play.*** 

- Chemistry
> I used to want to be a chemist. I have experience in the lab, I have done undergraduate research to varying degrees. 
> I won't say that I deserve any credit for it, for the most part it was a pursuit that I loved with all my heart,
> but unfortunately the career outlook felt bleak. Since I also loved math and technology, computer science was 
> also a great choice to pursue for a career. I stand by this decision, but I still love chemistry and biology.
> *if you are curious, I was interested in analytical chemistry, particularly in the environment. I studied 
> heavy metals, measurments, and safety protocols and techniques. My professor Armando was a great guy.*
> **Shoutout to Trey and Rick as well, they are wonderful instructors. Our teachers are valuable.**

- History
> All cliché's aside, history is important. It does not bore me one bit. I am always interested to hear your 
> about the historical topics you may be knowledgable in. I value **Archives** as well. 

## Anything else?

If you made it this far, then also shoutout to:
**GNU, the FSF, the Linux Foundation, Project Euler, W3, Tom Scott, Sam Curry, Karl Dahlke, and the guy who does 'low level learning' on Youtube**
